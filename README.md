# Postman connector to the [Meteomatics Weather API](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/weather-api/)

Meteomatics provides a REST-style API to retrieve historic, current, and forecast data globally. This includes model data and observational data in time series and areal formats. Areal formats are also offered through a WMS/WFS-compatible interface. Geographic and time series data can be combined in certain file formats, such as NetCDF.

This is an example set for Postman to showcase some of the capabilities of the Meteomatics weather API. Upload the file in your Postman workspace to use it. The documentation of the API can be found on [api.meteomatics.com](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/getting-started/).
